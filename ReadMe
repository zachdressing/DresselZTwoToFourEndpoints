Peer Review: The code works very well, each endpoint works and outputs correctly. 
The only thing that was "broken" is that a nummber value can be passed in the "name" area for the wakeUpTime endpoint and a number 
larger than the alotted AM timezone. Other then that the endpoint routes were a little confusing to get to work in postman but I was 
able to get it eventually. Overall Very good stuff.
